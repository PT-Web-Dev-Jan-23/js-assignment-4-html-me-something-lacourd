               <h1 id="problem">The Problem</h1>
               <p>When I shoved the boardgame into yet another closet, I had to admit it to myselfâ€”things had gotten out of hand.</p>
            </header>
         <p>At some point early in the pandemic, I decided to enter into the world of tabletop gaming. I had always enjoyed playing board games as a kid, and the few modern board games I had played with friends had captivated me. The combination of sleek marketing and attractive components created a further lure.</p>
         <p>I focused primarily on cooperative games, as a way of future-proofing for my then-too-young children to play with me in the future. My thinking was that games where we work together as a team would be a little more palatable.</p>
         <p>My boardgame collection sits at 36 different games, which doesn't seem totally unreasonable (though it's definitely more than most people probably have). Many of those games have expansion content, however, and so if you were to count all of those boxes my collection quickly exceeds 70 games!</p>
         <p>As far as favorites are concerned, the Arkham Horror Files series of games from Fantasy Flight Games tend to intruige me the most. Games like <a href=" ">Elder Sign</a>, a sort of glorified Cthulu-Yahtzee, <a href="">Eldritch Horror</a>, which is a globe-trotting adventure game with lots of entertaining story beats, and <a href="">Arkham Horror: The Card Game</a>, a card-game-meets-board-game-meets-RPG, all take up a ton of space in my collection.</p>
         <p>Competitive games in my collection include the entire Disney Villainous line (as well as Star Wars: Villainous), Sagrada, Sushi Go!, Dixit, and Flamecraft.</p>
         <p>The problem, of course, is that I have neither the time nor the opportunity to play all of these games!</p>
         <p>Ultimately, it feels like these games (and buying these games) represent an attempt to capture hoped-for social connection and immersive quality-time.</p>

               <h2 class="caseStudy">Case Study: <em>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</em></h2>
                  <p>This game is amazing. You choose a character, build a deck of cards, and then take that deck of card into a scenario.</p>
                  <p>Most scenarios have you trying to earn "clue" tokens before the game accrues too many "doom" tokens. Your character moves around a locations (special cards that are laid out on the table, essentially creating a board), attempting to pass skill tests, all while a menacing Encounter deck throws trecheries and enemies (essentially obstacles) at you.</p>
                  <p>The game launched in 2016, and I had become aware of it a few years afterward, but I didn't pull the trigger on the game until the pandemic.</p>
                  <p>The game is branded as a "Living Card Game," which has its DNA in collectible card games in the sense of acquiring more cards to improve your options, but unlike collectible card games where the packs are random and so you have to buy tons of cards in the hopes of getting a rare card, the LCG model has fixed cards in every pack. In theory friendlier on the wallet, but with the 10 additional products I've bought for Arkham Horror: The Card Game, still quite the investment.</p>
                  <p>As much as I love the lore and theme of the game, though, I NEVER get a chance to play it! Set up can be extensive, and sessions typically take about an hour. The game can be played solo, which is how I have to do most gaming (the theme is a little intense for my kids and partner), and I haven't had much luck finding a group to play with regularly.

               <h1 id="pattern">The Pattern</h1>
                  <p>In reflecting on my board game acquisitions (and attendant podcast listening, sale browsing, accessorizing, etc.), I realized that I had been down this path before.</p>
            </header>
            <p>If I'm honest with myself (and with you, dear reader), board games are only the latest instatiation of a pattern I've had my whole adult life:</p>
            <ol>
                  <li>Find a niche hobby</li>
                  <li>Go all in</li>
                  <li>Acquire too much stuff, both as part of the hobby and part of the "bling"</li>
                  <li>Grow frustrated by not fully enjoying the hobby after spending all this time and money to develop</li>
                  <li>Notice a new, shiny object</li>
                  <li>Repeat</li>
               </ol>
            <p>Before board games, it was fountain pens. Before foutain pens, it was video games. Before video games, it was bourbon and cocktails. Before bourbon, it was guitars and recording equipment. Before that, it may have been Dragon Ball Z (we're getting pretty far back in my history here).</p>
               <aside><h2 class="caseStudy">Case Study: Fountain Pens</h2>
                  <p>Look at how much time I spent on fountain pens!</p>

               <h1 id="closer">The Principle</h1>
               <p>Ultimately, I'm neither surprised nor embarrassed by my history of frequent hobby changing.</p>
               <p>As humannn beings, we are searching for someting to fulfill us, for something to give us meaning.</p>
